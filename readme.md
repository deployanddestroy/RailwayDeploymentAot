## Railway + .NET 8.0 Deployment

Example project used in a video demonstration of how to deploy a .NET 8.0 project to Railway.

### Notes
While this is mostly a fresh Web API (AoT) template, there are some slight changes to `Program.cs` and two new files: `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml`. Check the video for more information.

Happy deploying!
